A linked list is similar to an array, in that it is an ordered set of data elements. However, unlike an array (which relies on index locations), each element contains a link to its successor (and sometimes its predecessor). These elements are called nodes. This is a demonstration of a linked list implemented in Ruby. All of the class methods are recursive.
